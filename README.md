# Colour Scheme Generator
This is a personal project that is meant to generate colour schemes of a chosen colour, using a ColorAPI and plain HTML/CSS/JS. 

As an extension, a colour contrast feature was added to allow you to seamlessly compare any two chosen colours. 

Access here if you'd like :))
